## Script name:		reboot_scheduler.sh
## Script author:	Mike Morales
## Last change:		2015-06-04

## Synopsis:

## reboot_scheduler is intended to be used after software updates have been installed on a Mac
## that require a reboot.
## Rather than initiating an immediate reboot of the Mac, or only allowing a short grace period
## before a reboot occurs, the script can be used to prompt the logged in user to select a reboot time
## from a few options in a dialog. (uses cocoaDialog)
##
## Alternately, when the script is being run from a Casper Suite policy, a value in minutes can also be
## passed to the script in Parameter 4 ($4), which will set up a future reboot schedule. In this mode,
## the user is notified of when the 5 minute countdown will begin before their Mac reboots.
##
## In either situation, a LaunchDaemon with a specific StartCalendarInterval and a script will then 
## be created. The LaunchDaemon is set up to run the script at the appointed StartCalendarInterval time,
## which will then start a 5 minute countdown, but only if the Mac has not already been rebooted in
## the interim by the user.

## 	Script exit codes
##
## 0	Script exited successfully
## 1	Some date parameters necessary for the LaunchDaemon could not be determined
## 2	The LaunchDaemon and/or the script could not be created
## 3	The LaunchDaemon could not be loaded (launchctl error)
## 4	cocoaDialog could not be found in the specified location


## Path to cocoaDialog (Edit to match your environment)
cdPath="/Library/Application Support/JAMF/bin/cocoaDialog.app/Contents/MacOS/cocoaDialog"

## The value for mins to reboot. If left blank, we will get the selection from user input or passed in Parameter 4.
mins=""

## If Parameter 4 was assigned a value in the policy, check to see if its a whole integer.
## If true, override the above blank value for hrs with the value assigned to $4.
## If false, retain a blank assignment for the hrs value (user will be prompted to select)

## ***** VERY IMPORTANT!! PLEASE READ *****
## While not a strict requirement, it is recommended that you use values in minutes that are divisible by 60
## to equal whole hours, (ex: For 2 hours, enter "120" for 120 minutes)
##
## If a value is used that is not divisible by 60, the script will use a decimal value to display
## in the dialog presented to the user.
## (ex: 150 minutes will be converted to 1.5 hours as shown to the user)

## 1. 	ONLY PASS A VALUE THAT IS CONVERTED TO MINUTES (ex: To set a value for 2 hours, enter "120" for 120 minutes)
## 2. 	Values passed above 10 will result in a scheduled reboot using the LaunchDaemon.
## 3.   Values passed at or below 10 will result in a reboot timer appearing immediately to the user with a countdown

if [ ! -z "$4" ]; then
	## Check to make sure a whole integer was passed
	if [[ $(echo "$4 / $4" | bc) == "1" ]]; then
		mins="$4"
		echo "Pre-assigned minutes value was assigned: $mins"
	else
		mins=""
	fi
fi

## Set the minutes deferral optons here. Only used if a 'mins' value is not assigned in Parameter 4.
## These are used both in the dialogs and in the resulting scheduled time to reboot.

## ***** VERY IMPORTANT!! PLEASE READ *****
## 1. 	ONLY USE VALUES IN MINUTES FOR ALL THREE 'deferOpt' ITEMS BELOW
## 2. 	ONLY change the values between the quote marks. Do NOT change the values between the brackets []
## 	(Failure to recalculate into a minutes value will result in odd or very short deferrals for reboots occurring)
## 3. 	Start with the longest deferral value and work down. The final value can be set to 10 or lower to initiate an immediate reboot countdown

## Example: To set your longest deferral option to 8 hours, enter a value of "480" for 'deferOpt[0]'

deferOpt[0]="120"		## Longest deferral option (usually results in 'hours')
deferOpt[1]="30"		## Shorter deferral option (still usually results in 'hours')
deferOpt[2]="5"			## Reboot soon option. Recommended not to exceed 10 (minutes). If value is above "10" it will revert to a normal delayed reboot

## Create an array with the assigned values
deferOpts=(${deferOpt[0]} ${deferOpt[1]} ${deferOpt[2]})

## Path to the log file
rdlog="/private/var/log/rdlog.log"

## Start new log file entry with date stamp
echo -e "Start timestamp:	$(date)" | tee -a "$rdlog"

## Sanity check for cocoaDialog
if [ ! -e "$cdPath" ]; then
	echo -e "Error 4: cocoaDialog could not be found at: $cdPath. Exiting...\n" | tee -a "$rdlog"
	exit 4

## 1. Calculate specified mins in seconds
hrsSecs=$((mins*60))

## 2. Get the current time in seconds
currSecs=$(date +"%s")
## 3. Generate scheduled reboot date (current time in seconds + hrs in seconds) in seconds
futureSecs=$((currSecs+hrsSecs))
## 4. Convert scheduled reboot date into 'day_hour_minute_month' format
rDate=$(date -jf "%s" "$futureSecs" +"%d_%H_%M_%m")
## 5. Convert scheduled reboot date into readable format for dialog
rDateFormat=$(date -jf "%s" "$futureSecs" +"%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p")

## 1. Compare the last boot time in seconds with the creation timestamp of the script (in Unix seconds).

## 		b)	If the creation timestamp value is higher than the last boot time, the Mac has not been
